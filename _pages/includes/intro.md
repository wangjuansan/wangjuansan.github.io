<!-- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Juan Wang(çŽ‹å¨Ÿ in Chinese). I work at [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) <a href='https://damo.alibaba.com/' target="_blank"><img src='./images/alibaba.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 78px;'></a> as an Algorithm Expert in Hangzhou. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/zju.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2024, affiliated with a joint program with [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/westlake.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> at [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). Before that, I received my B.Eng. Degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/whu.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2019. -->

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a PhD student of [the Laboratory for Image Information Communications](http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/) <a href="http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/" target="_blank"></a> at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank"></a> under the supervisor of Prof. [Shinichiro Omachi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5YWMFLUAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received M.S. from [HoHai University](https://en.hhu.edu.cn/) <a href="https://en.hhu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"></a> in Jun. 2021 and B.S. from JiShou University in Jun. 2018.


<!-- ðŸ”¬ My research has centered on the **3D perception, understanding, reasoning, and generation of multimodal (including images, videos, language, dynamics, etc.) data from both the internet and the physical world**. I also focus on **efficientAI** (in terms of data, time, parameters, memory, etc.) for multimodal applications. I have published 20+ papers <a class='all_citation_badges' href="" target="_blank"></a> on the above topics at the top-tier international AI conferences. Recently, I devote myself to the development of multi-modal generative, embodied, and unified foundation models. -->
